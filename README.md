# Resources
Below is an overview of handy resources for learning the mathematics required for the Bachelor AI program at the UvA.

## Calculus
  - [3Blue1Brown: Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GT3co4r2wlh6UHTUeQsrf3mlS2lk6x): Understand the intuitition behind calculus through animated video's.
  - [Khan: Multivariable Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC5feHa6Rc5c0wbRTx56nF7): Understand & practice multivariable calculus.
    - note: requires working knowledge of linear algebra (vector & matrix operations); learn about linear algebra first.

## Linear Algebra:
- [3Blue1Brown: Essense of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B): Understand the intuitition behind calculus through animated video's. 
    - note: after you get the intuition right, it's very important to practice matrix and vector operations; the AI program at the UvA does not only require you understand what you're doing, it also requires you to solve tackle certain recurring problems / tasks at speed so they become second nature.
- [MathTheBeautiful](https://www.youtube.com/@MathTheBeautiful/playlists): Although Gilbert Strang's youtube lectures on linear algebra are much more famous, I prefer Pavel Grinfeld's way of teaching, especially for understanding and practicing matrix & vector operations & decompositions.
  - Note: Pavel has many playlists about the subject, some more useful for what you need to learn at the UvA than others. I think ["Part3: Linear Transformations"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXfTHzgMRUIqYrutsFXCOmiqKUgOgGJ5) best fits the UvA program, but you might need to search back and forth in his playlists to fill in potential missing gaps in knowledge.
